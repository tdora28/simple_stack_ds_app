# Simple Stack Data Structure App

This is an assignment for Business College Helsinki (REACT23S Databases and Data Structures)

## Assignment

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)

## Specs/Requirements:

- Use ReactJS to create your app
- Keep it short and simple, e.g. one button that shows pushing items to stack and another button that shows poping items out of stack
- Feel free to use any react component library or hooks e.g. useState, useMemo
- Use whatever css, styling you learned in other courses
- You may use CSS framework if needed e.g. React Bootstrap / Material UI or whatever for styling GUI
